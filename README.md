# Purpose<br>
A random password generator that is anchored in JavaScript functions and displayed with HTML and CSS. The password generator takes input from the user, using window prompts, and uses that selected criteria to generate a new, random password. The password generator resets so the user can request as many new, random passwords as wanted.<br>
<br>
